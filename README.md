# Flappy-bird
Overview

This project is a clone of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, implemented using the Pygame library. The player controls a bird, navigating it through a series of pipes without hitting them. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score by passing through as many pipes as possible.

How to Play

1. Game Start: The game starts with the bird ready to fly. The player needs to press a key to make the bird flap its wings.
2. Controls:
     Flap: Press the spacebar or any other designated key to make the bird flap its wings and move upward.
3. Objective: Guide the bird through gaps between pipes to earn points. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes earns you one point.
4. Game Over: The game ends if the bird hits a pipe or the ground.

Enjoy the Game!
